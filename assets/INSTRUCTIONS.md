# Instructions
Begin here. These are the instructions to understand the filesystem and structure of the website, host the website locally, and run all of the demonstrations. 

## [`FILESYSTEM.MD`](FILESYSTEM.MD)
Open and read the contents of [`FILESYSTEM.MD`](FILESYSTEM.MD). It contains the structure of the filesystem that is used for this project. While no action is directly associated with this step, it is important to be familiar with this file and understand how the filesystem works for future purposes of potential debugging or editing. Once you are familiar with the filesystem structure, proceed to the [next step](#initiatemd).

## [`INITIATE.MD`](INITIATE.MD)
Open [`INITIATE.MD`](INITIATE.MD) and follow its instructions. It contains four steps to [Setup `XAMPP`, `Apache`, `MySQL`, and `PHP`](INITIATE.MD#setup-xampp-apache-mysql-and-php), [Setup `Demonstrations`](INITIATE.MD#setup-demonstrations), [Setup `authentication` and `chats` databases](INITIATE.MD#setup-authentication-and-chats-databases), and [Setup `xss-redirect.xlsm` and `xss-keylogger.xlsm` malicious scripts](INITIATE.MD#setup-xss-redirectxlsm-and-xss-keyloggerxlsm-malicious-scripts). Once all steps are completed here, the entire website should be fully functional and you may proceed to the [next step](#demonstrationsmd)

## [`DEMONSTRATIONS.MD`](DEMONSTRATIONS.MD)
Open [`DEMONSTRATIONS.MD`](DEMONSTRATIONS.MD) and follow its instructions. It contains step-by-step instructions for each demonstration. You are done after learning and running through each demonstration and may return to [README.MD](../README.MD).
